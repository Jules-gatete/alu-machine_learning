# Classification

Classification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict discrete class labels for new instances based on past observations.

## Overview

This section covers various classification algorithms and techniques, including:

- Binary Classification
- Multi-class Classification
- Common Algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Contents

Each subdirectory contains examples and implementations of different classification techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have activated your virtual environment
2. Install required dependencies:

```python   
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each algorithm implementation includes example usage and documentation in its respective directory.
